## Explicit limitations (never silent skips)

- **J33** (local-only): The R20-E encoding runs the FULL J33 flow (choose source → connect → preview → confirm → feed appears → sync → reauthorization gap → recovery → disconnect → explicit delete) over the REAL shared composition the fixtures boot wires: the FeedImportService (R20-C) running the real reconciliation and the REAL YouTube connector (R20-B) answering importFeedResult from its documented recorded API fixtures (the same recorded-shape determinism the connectors' and persistence's own integration tests use — no fixture-only production claim: the code path IS the shipped composition). The REAL provider round trips — a live Google OAuth consent, live Data API quota, a real Takeout export — require provisioned credentials and the service-mode boot; they remain local-only.
  - procedure: LOCAL-ONLY: provision YOUTUBE_* credentials (the frozen .env names), boot apps/api over a PostgreSQL database (DATABASE_URL + APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY) with the YouTube connector wired to its fetch transport, boot apps/web in service mode (WFX_API_BASE) once the feed-import service routes are wired (the lead's R20-H integration step), drive the /settings sources connect flow with a real Google account, and capture each BYOF state under evidence/<run>/ — then run this runner with --base-url against that service boot.
