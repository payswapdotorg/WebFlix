| J38 | First-class torrent playback (web: browser-capable + honest fallbacks) | **FAIL** | 5 | 2 |

## Explicit limitations (never silent skips)

- **J38** (configuration-limit): The R23-W2 web encoding drives the FIRST-CLASS peer-copy surfaces end to end over the fixtures' scripted acquisition feed (the same protocol-free facts through the REAL acquisition store the J21-J26 chain validates), the honest Desktop next step for ordinary swarms, and the adapter/WebRTC environment truth behind progressive disclosure. A REAL WebRTC swarm — live hybrid peers streaming bytes into the browser video element through the R23-D adapter — requires a reachable swarm the sandbox does not have; the adapter binding (webtorrent@3.0.21 browser build, lazy-loaded) is the real code path for that environment.
  - procedure: LOCAL-ONLY (the WebRTC-capable scenario): serve a .torrent whose swarm includes WebRTC-capable peers (a WebTorrent hybrid client seeding legally-owned content) over a reachable wss tracker, register the authorized copy on the source, open its player, and capture the live streaming + the verified-asset landing under evidence/<run>/; the Desktop native path is Worker 3's J38 procedure.
- **J33** (local-only): The R20-E encoding runs the FULL J33 flow (choose source → connect → preview → confirm → feed appears → sync → reauthorization gap → recovery → disconnect → explicit delete) over the REAL shared composition the fixtures boot wires: the FeedImportService (R20-C) running the real reconciliation and the REAL YouTube connector (R20-B) answering importFeedResult from its documented recorded API fixtures (the same recorded-shape determinism the connectors' and persistence's own integration tests use — no fixture-only production claim: the code path IS the shipped composition). The REAL provider round trips — a live Google OAuth consent, live Data API quota, a real Takeout export — require provisioned credentials and the service-mode boot; they remain local-only.
  - procedure: LOCAL-ONLY: provision YOUTUBE_* credentials (the frozen .env names), boot apps/api over a PostgreSQL database (DATABASE_URL + APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY) with the YouTube connector wired to its fetch transport, boot apps/web in service mode (WFX_API_BASE) once the feed-import service routes are wired (the lead's R20-H integration step), drive the /settings sources connect flow with a real Google account, and capture each BYOF state under evidence/<run>/ — then run this runner with --base-url against that service boot.
