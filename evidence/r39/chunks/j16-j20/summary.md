## Explicit limitations (never silent skips)

- **J16** (local-only): Profile-LEVEL anti-tunnel (a concentrated watch history not permanently dominating the profile) is R05's service-side recommendation policy; the web fixtures session has no persistent profile. The feed-level exploration mechanics (kept runway, multi-item composition) are encoded.
  - procedure: LOCAL-ONLY: the service-mode boot + a concentrated watch history through /experience/history, then verify the recommendation composition retains exploration (the R05 policy tests' scenario) with captured evidence.
- **J17** (local-only): The explicit intent VOCABULARY (learn/happier/surprise/tonight/friend-taste) is the service-side intent submission (apps/api /experience/intents — session-scoped by design). The web session's query-intent mechanics (state/retain/replace, no preference corruption) are encoded.
  - procedure: LOCAL-ONLY: the service-mode boot + submit each intent kind through /experience/intents, verify the session-scoped composition and the untouched long-term policy, and capture the affected feed surfaces.
- **J18** (local-only): SWITCHING attention modes (mindful=3-swipe / immersive=none / custom) is the service-side policy submission (apps/api /experience/policy). The web session boots the balanced default; its observable threshold behavior (no re-rank below 5, re-rank at 5) is encoded.
  - procedure: LOCAL-ONLY: the service-mode boot + set each attention mode through /experience/policy, then drive the short feed and capture the mode-specific re-rank behavior (mindful fires at 3 swipes; immersive does not auto re-rank).
- **J19** (local-only): R21-B/R21-C: the web transport implements the R06 reads (model-policy, model-providers, BYOM, transforms) and the Model & AI section renders the REAL provider registry + per-task policy truth over them (the fixtures persona answers the service shapes). The real service-backed policy WRITES and BYOM key bindings run against the configured service (apps/api /experience/model-policy, /model-providers, BYOM routes) — the fixtures boot exercises the shapes deterministically.
  - procedure: LOCAL-ONLY: the service-mode boot + exercise the model-policy/provider routes (BYOM key binding, local-model policy, privacy constraints), capturing the policy surfaces.
- **J20** (local-only): R21-E: the AI ACTION TRAY is the web surface of the completed transforms transport (the R21-B/R21-C model-controls seam — the fixtures persona answers the service shapes deterministically): the five frozen actions, the model-class truth, the named preconditions, and the typed queued/cancelled operation states are encoded. The full pipeline's running→succeeded transitions (real progress + result payloads) are the service-side fabric (apps/api /experience/transforms).
  - procedure: LOCAL-ONLY: the service-mode boot + start each transformation operation through the tray (or /experience/transforms), capture the explicit running and completed states with results.
